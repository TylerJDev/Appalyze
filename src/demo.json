      "Snake, you of course know the saying \"One for all, all for one.\"\r",
      "Oh, I figured you'd need a lot of motivation, so I came prepared. It's from 'The Three Musketeers' -- the book, not the candy bar. Anyway, it means that if you go up against everyone by yourself, they'll gang up on you too. I think. Since you're on your own on that ship, you need to take this to heart and avoid confrontations. How was that? Just like the old days, huh?\r",
      "Of course! And I'll teach you a lot more of these, you can count on it.\r",
      "Okay... There's a saying that goes \"Even a bird on high dies a glutton's death, as do the fish of The Deeps.\" The lesson is -- er, don't be greedy. The fish that belonged to a family called the Deeps died from overfeeding, and so did a bird that got high on something -- probably fermented fruit.\r",
      "I do, Snake. Don't take unnecessary risks just because you're greedy for more Items. Remember the Deep family's fish.\r",
      "Another Chinese proverb. \"Those who look to the Heavens prosper, those who defy it are no more.\" Do you know this one? The meaning here is -- hold on a sec -- that you can only survive as long as you're a part of the natural order of things. You remember pre-ripped jeans? Manufacturers thought that just because people loved old, broken-in jeans, they would want to buy new jeans that looked old. So they purposefully --\r",
      "Denim should fray and rip on its own, naturally. Right? Some designers tried to go against that, and -- no one bought them! The earnings report from that fiscal year is enough of a proof!\r",
      "Hey, Snake, what's \"Hardest won, most easily lost\"? It's time, get it? Amazing how relevant these Chinese proverbs still are! Once the moment's gone, it's gone. Except for daylight savings time, of course. That extra hour to do anything you like with every autumn... gotta love it. Then again, you lose an hour every spring, so I guess the proverbs are right. Wow, they thought of everything.\r",
      "Of course not! They knew how to save time. We're the ones that need to be tricked into it.\r",
      "The moment never returns, Snake. Let's not waste it on idle questions.\r",
      "The Chinese have a saying \"Those who are lost never question a path, and a drowning man doubts not the shallows.\" And it means -- means that you need to make use of other people's help. Otherwise, you could be in trouble. If you're lost, you don't even know whether a road you come across is a right one, and, uh, what's the difference between shallow and deep if you've already drowned... right? Anyway, the point is that help is always a good thing to accept. So make good use of the Codec.\r",
      "Hey, she couldn't do better herself!\r",
      "\"Acquaintances agree. Friends argue.\" That's a straightforward one. The better friends you are, the more openly you can disagree with each other. So feel free to present a counterpoint if you don't agree with what I'm saying. Argue away!\r",
      "...Not a promising start. OK, forget what I said -- just go along with my advice.\r",
      "Do you know the saying \"One forgets the hurt once the wound has healed\"? And that of course means -- uh -- where'd I put that piece of paper --\r",
      "No, nothing. So, uh, forgetting the pain when the wound's healed means... Um -- That you have to get better fast! Yeah, that's it. So stock up on those rations and bandages.\r",
      "Snake: No. Which means that there's someone besides us and the Russians that are interested in the new Metal Gear prototype...\rOtacon: Cyphers can stay airborne for about three hours, so there should be an Integrated Mobile Ground Station controlling its flight pattern and output nearby -- it's got to be on land. I'll bet you anything it's disguised as a regular truck or something, driving along riverside. Let me check it out.\r",
      "Otacon: Cyphers can stay airborne for about three hours, so there should be an Integrated Mobile Ground Station controlling its flight pattern and output nearby -- it's got to be on land. I'll bet you anything it's disguised as a regular truck or something, driving along riverside. Let me check it out.\rSnake: Good call.\r",
      "Er -- oh yeah, that too. Very good, Snake.\r",
      "Otacon: The new Metal Gear.\rSnake: Why are they broadcasting this?\r",
      "Otacon: They probably want to keep a record of this exercise -- and maybe give a little presentation?\rSnake: Presentation?\r",
      "Otacon: That ship's been transmitting a live video feed via military satellite uplink for a while now.\rSnake: So there's some brass out there, smacking their lips over this little home movie.\r",
      "Otacon: I've been trying to pinpoint the receiving location, but I haven't had much luck. There's a heavy duty firewall in the way. I'll try some more, though.\rSnake: Wherever it is, it must be a warm, dry office with hot coffee on tap.\r",
      "Snake: Wherever it is, it must be a warm, dry office with hot coffee on tap.\rOtacon: A far cry from that tanker, huh? That's what happens when the battlefield has a Revolution in Military \r",
      "The Chinese have a proverb that goes \"Scholars hold in esteem knowledge, not acts.\" See, they just sit around thinking, instead of actually doing something. Which doesn't make them too useful. Action is what matters! I think.\r",
      "Snake, have you noticed that you bring her up a lot?\r",
      "Here we go again. What am I going to do with you?\r",
      "You and your hyperactive libido. It's a good thing one of us can keep all the details straight.\r",
      "This is my favorite Chinese saying: \"Better to be first among roosters than last among bulls.\" Of course, the meaning's clear If you have to choose between being a chicken or a cow, pick the chicken. Cows are always being messed with by aliens -- cattle mutilations are up, you know. Why go looking for trouble, right? If an enemy spots you, you'll be in more trouble than a cow on a UFO. You stay out of their sight!\r",
      "Everyone knows they've been visiting us for thousands of years.\r",
      "Snake, do you know the Chinese proverb \"Care avoids err\"? \"Err\" is thought to be a�! Kung word meaning \"what.\" There are some linguists who think that this accounts for an almost universal utterance�� of the syllable \"er\" when people are at a loss of words. A kind of vestigal --\r",
      "Ack!\r",
      "Er --\r",
      "Er, that's really a...\r",
      "It's not what you think...\r",
      "Er, Mei Ling, we're in the middle of a mission and everything! So can we, you know...\r",
      "...\r",
      "Yeah, Snake! Good luck!\r",
      "Ack...\r",
      "Err...\r",
      "Hee. She got mad and went offline.\r",
      "Nothing! Now don't we need to get back to the mission? So much to do, so little time...\r",
      "Snake, don't let the enemy spot you. Once you've been discovered by a sentry, he'll call in reinforcements and there will be an attack. Even you're no match for that level of organized assault. They have better weapons too, remember? We aren't terrorists, okay? Avoid unnecessary confrontations and go for total stealth. All right?\r",
      "Snake, if you sustain damage from enemy attacks, it could increase your chances of capture. The bloodstains would lead them right to you. That's another reason you should stay away from trouble as much as possible.\r",
      "These aren't sentries you're dealing with; they're searching for you, and they know you don't want to be found. You can't make some feeble attempt at concealment. Make sure you're completely hidden in some place they wouldn't think of something.\r",
      "According to intelligence, this new model was designed to combat all the clone models of Metal\r",
      "But was that -- was money really Ocelot's end objective?\r",
      "I do. Nothing definite, but acquiring a large sum of money is always a good starting point for another project.\r",
      "Anyway, every country that paid off Ocelot is racing to produce its own bipedal tank -- one that can launch the so-called \"invisible nuclear warhead.\" If the whole world has a Metal Gear, the military dominance of the U.S. will disappear. In a world where Metal Gear has become commonplace, the only way to regain the upper hand is to possess a weapon even more\r",
      "Exactly. The arms race must go on.\r",
      "The Metal Gear that the tanker is transporting is being developed under Marine Corps jurisdiction. But -- I've also heard a rumor that the Navy is working on its own Metal Gear.\r",
      "I tried to hack some out, but security was too tight. There's a lot of money being allocated -- that's for sure. But every one of my investigations takes me to one name, then hits a brick wall. The name is \"The Patriots.\"\r",
      "I wish I knew. I have no idea if this is an individual, or an organization, even. But once we expose the presence of this Marine Corps Metal Gear to the world, maybe that will shake the \"Patriots\" out of the tree. This mission is partly about that too.\r",
      "When the photos are in, we'll put them online and blow this whole thing\r",
      "Probably. But it won't matter -- there'll be mirror sites spawning within minutes after those images go up. We won't even have to ask; people will be grabbing the pictures. There's no way anyone can stop it. Information has a life of its own, and as long as it lasts, it'll keep\r",
      "Yeah -- the desire of people to learn. The demand for data.\r",
      "Everyone's got some of that. And sometimes, it can pave the way for\r",
      "She's not dead, is she?\r",
      "Good.\r",
      "What's gotten into you?\r",
      "Sleeping Beauty may have been awakened by Prince Charming's kiss, but you'd better not try it here.\r",
      "Snake, that shadow --\r",
      "Otacon: I had Snake check everything out. Sure, there are some facilities to clean up the pollution, but they're not running at full capacity. Don't you think it's funny that even though two years have gone by since the incident, they haven't managed to clean up all the crude oil? Of course, the media doesn't report that kind of thing. I think they're having fresh shipments of crude oil brought in to replace the stuff they've cleaned up. The story you were told about toxic chemicals being released if the plant were blown up also seems pretty fishy. I don't think its actually true. Information is being suppressed on a huge scale. These guys seem to think that the new Metal Gear is worth all the effort and money they're spending on it.\rRaiden: ...So I've been lied to all along...\r",
      "Otacon: No, I think even your CO didn't know what was going on. That's probably what he's been telling you.\rRaiden: I didn't mean by the Colonel. I meant by you.\r",
      "Otacon: Huh? We never lied to you! We just didn't tell you everything, that's all.\rRaiden: ...\r",
      "Otacon: Ha ha. You know, you're a pretty interesting guy. You're just like Snake said.\rRaiden: ...What did he say?\r",
      "Otacon: That you're a weak, simple-minded, stubborn fool.\rRaiden: A-a weak, simple-minded...\r",
      "Raiden: A-a weak, simple-minded...\rOtacon: Ah, don't worry, he didn't mean anything bad by it.\r",
      "Otacon: Ah, don't worry, he didn't mean anything bad by it.\rRaiden: \"Nothing bad\"? What could possibly be worse than that? That lying, useless, backstabbing, mincing son of a --\r",
      "Otacon: Raiden, I'm his friend. I know him better than anyone else. I know he's not that kind of guy.\rRaiden: Yeah? So what?\r",
      "Otacon: And, by the way... there's one more thing you should probably know about Snake.\rRaiden: What?\r",
      "Raiden: What?\rOtacon: He's right here.\r",
      "Raiden: ...Next to you?\rOtacon: Yep.\r",
      "Raiden: Did he hear....\rOtacon: Every word.\r",
      "Snake: ...\rRaiden: I'm, uh...I'm just gonna get back to the mission right now.\r",
      "Maybe. But we're fighting to upset the status quo too, aren't we?\r",
      "So who was that Olga person?\r",
      "Snake: Because someone planted one.\rOtacon: What about that guy who was running on water? Could have been him.\r",
      "Hey, Snake, you found a handgun.\r",
      "That gun can take out the infrared sensors you just saw. The USP fires real bullets -- not the knockout rounds the M9 uses. You know that, right? The USP isn't equipped with a suppressor, either. If you fire it when there are enemies nearby, they'll probably hear it. Keep that in mind. Having the USP will make combat easier, but being undetected is still the best way to go. OK?\r",
      "The Cypher's what it looks like -- a flying surveillance saucer. It's an unmanned aerial vehicle used for ground and ocean surveillance, and it also assists in communication. It can take off and land vertically, and uses a ducted airstream from its rotors and the surrounding shroud to fly. The one you saw was the type used by the Army, if I recall. But I can't see the Army officially cooperating with a top-secret Marine Corps project...\r",
      "Look at the TV over there. It's showing the hold.\r",
      "The Marine Corps' defining character is that of an emergency response team in crisis situations. But the Army's been steadily enlarging its own crisis response capabilities, building on the strength of their Medium Brigade. Analysis is that the Marine Corps sees this as an infringement on their own domain, and is more than a little alarmed. We both know that Metal Gear REX was being developed for deployment by the Army. So it does make sense that the Marines are trying to compete with their own version of Metal Gear.\r",
      "So the Commandant says the Navy is leaning on them, huh? I'm sure the Navy isn't happy about the new Metal Gear prototype being developed. From what I can tell, the new model can make an approach, launch an attack, and execute takeoffs from the ocean without any support. If the weapon makes it past the testing stage, it could render aircraft carriers, battleships, even submarines obsolete. It's a matter of life or death for the Navy as an organization... And if it's true that the Navy has its own Metal Gear in the works, that's another reason for them to get nervous.\r",
      "You heard the Commandant mention the NMD -- the National Missile Defense program. It was conceptualized late last century as a defense network to detect and engage enemy ICBM's launched at the continental United States. But at the same time, it came under fire for contributing to nuclear \r",
      "Snake, you have an empty magazine in your hand. Why are you still carrying that around?\r",
      "Select the magazine and throw it using the Weapon button. The noise will draw enemy soldiers toward wherever the magazine lands. How strong you push the button determines how large a swing you take. Take aim using First Person View and try to land it where it will lure the enemy away.\r",
      "What you're wielding right now is a converted Beretta M-92F, designed to fire tranquilizer rounds. A direct hit will knock the target unconscious. Think of those rounds as tiny syringes. The impact of the round causes the mixing of two chemicals in the shell. The resulting gas compresses a tiny piston and injects the tranquilizer in the bullet's tip into the target's skin. The tranquilizer's effects are felt at different times depending on where the bullet lands. A head or heart shot will take effect immediately, but a round that hits somewhere like feet or hands will take a while. Use the First Person View Attack for maximum accuracy. The gun is fitted with a suppressor, so there is no need to worry about alerting the enemy with the noise. But since it is a tranquilizer gun, the M9 has its limitations. All it can do is knock the enemy unconscious. Keep that in mind.\r",
      "Snake, that handgun of yours is a USP. The USP comes in a variety of calibers, from a 9mm to a .45. Yours is a 9mm, with 15 rounds per magazine. It's also equipped with a flashlight for nighttime shooting. In the dark, select the USP and aim to turn on the light. Unlike the M9, the USP isn't suppressor-equipped. The gunshots may bring enemy reinforcements running, so be careful.\r",
      "Hey, you have a chaff grenade. You can use that to interfere with enemy radio communications... and electronic devices for a short time. The chaff grenade is a weapon that disperses aluminum foil or metalcoated glass and plastic fibers to confuse the enemy radar. What you have is a portable application of the chaff- launchers built into fighter planes. When detonated, the grenade releases tiny chaff pieces as well as miniaturized active jammers using a small amount of explosives. The grenade can't create full-scale chaff corridors or chaff clouds, but will form a Radar Cross Section area large enough for single-personnel use. This weapon is for electronic interference only, though. It has no effect on enemy personnel.\r",
      "The stun grenade in your equipment is for incapacitating enemies without killing them. Stun grenades are non-lethal weapons that knock out enemy personnel with an intense flash of light and a burst of sound. Once the grenade is airborne, a timed detonator ejects an internal cartridge using a small amount of explosives. The cartridge then explodes, and releases a flash rated at over a million candlepower, with an accompanying bang of over 200 decibels. The combinations of the flash and the bang temporarily overwhelms human sensory perceptions. There are no projectiles released, so it can only knock out enemies, not wound them. Keep that in mind.\r",
      "Good, you have a pair of binoculars. You'll be able to use them to survey enemy territory from a distance. They come with a zoom function and auto-focus, and have all the durability of military equipment. You won't have to worry about breakage with these.\r",
      "So you've got rations now. These are military food supplies, and allow you to recover some LIFE with use. If it is equipped in advance, the ration will automatically be used and LIFE will be regained when you receive damage. You can select it in the window and push the confirmation button to use the item on the spot. Rations were designed to be carried and eaten on the field. They're all about functionality and calories. They use a special freeze-drying methods developed by NROC. They're compact, portable, and last for weeks.\r",
      "You've picked up gel bandages, I see. When you're bleeding, select the bandage as an equipment to stop the blood. The bandage is a type of alginate dressing. It's a highly absorbent pad that gels blood and other fluids on contact. It releases calcium ions during absorption, hence the coagulating effect.\r",
      "Snake, are you smoking? You really should quit. First of all, it turns you into an instant target in the dark. As for what it means to your health, I won't even go there. Remember what Naomi said about lung cancer rates? Everyone knows that it's a dangerous substance.\r",
      "Well, you can screw up your own body if you like, but think about other people, okay?\r",
      "Oh really? Didn't I see you toss the butt off the bridge? Littering, polluting...\r",
      "You have a long way to go, my friend.\r",
      "The copter's designed for survival in combat and the main systems are expandable. The rotors are capable of functioning if they've been punctured.\rIn addition, the Kasatka's features a polyurethane-filled fuel tank to minimize the danger of explosion. However, the Kasatka cannot hold its own against a Harrier. It's only suitable for providing you with air support. What I'm trying to say is that it's up to you to take out the Harrier.\r",

      "We're currently aboard a Ka-60 Kasatka helicopter, a multi-purpose military aircraft of the Russian Kamov Design Bureau. This copter is capable of handling various missions including troop and supply transport, medical evacuation, target acquisition for attack copters, and all-weather scouting. Equip it with the latest avionics and electronic equipment and the Kasatka can handle communication and electronic jamming as well as other special operations.\r",
      "Okay, Raiden. Let me talk to Emma.\r",
      "I did a quick inspection... Arsenal Gear's security system is similar to the antibiotic function of a living creature's immune system. Surveillance of the inner system is handled by periodic scans using a number of agents with the capacity for detecting data that doesn't belong in the system.\r",
      "Raiden, I asked E.E. about the disc you have in your possession. Basically, it's a set of computer worm programs. Each worm is structured to mimic the data units that compose GW. As a result, GW's scan agents are unable to detect the program. In short, the program doesn't trigger GW's antibody production system. What's more, the program can penetrate the Bit Brain Barrier that surrounds GW. Once the worm program enters the neural net, it transforms the surrounding neurons. The transformed neurons become solid and can no longer function as neural nets. As time passes, the neurons transform and perish,\r",
      "Raiden, take a look.\r",
      "Metal Gear RAY was originally designed by the Marines as a countermeasure against other Metal Gear variations. But the mass-produced model is only based on the Marines' design. It's been redesigned to guard Arsenal Gear. Now it protects another Metal Gear... I heard all this from Emma. It seems that the mass-production model Metal Gear RAYs have Cooperative Engagement Capability, with GW as the primary control system. Several RAYs can connect with Arsenal Gear and mutually exchange data. Within this unified domain, all RAYs can cooperatively manage threats through notification, pursuit, and interception -- all in a lifelike manner. All for one and one for all. There's no weak spot. When protected by a pack of RAYs, Arsenal Gear can move without cruisers or destroyers as escorts. Those mass-production model Metal Gear RAYs look like they're being serviced. I don't think they can move. Keep going.\r",
      "Nope, nothing yet. Just give me a little more time.\r",
      "The power suit that Solidus is wearing is a state-of-the-art exoskeleton that makes use of artificial muscle tissue. It gives the person wearing it superhuman motor skill capabilities. It's the same technology used in RAY's engine system and the Tengu soldiers' combat suits. Your skull suit uses a little bit of it, too. A number of sensors stretch between the surface and interior of the suit like a neural network. When these sensors detect an impact, the artificial muscle in the suit reacts instantaneously by automatically contracting and diffusing the damage. So you can't just chop him in half with your sword. Your suit uses the same technology. You could almost say that your suit, Solidus' suit, and Metal Gear RAY are like brothers...\r",
      "OK, Snake, let's start with the basics. I'll provide instructions via Codec. Some of these controls are new. It's best if you practice now before you get in the thick of things. Listen carefully to my instructions, and then give it a try. I've also set your Codec so that you can receive messages in listen-only mode. With EMCON implemented, there's less chance of you accidentally giving away your position.\r",
      "OctoCamo is a newly developed camouflage technology that's capable of almost exactly mimicking the appearance of objects and surfaces. Its easy to use, too. All you have to do is press against a wall or object, or lie flat on the ground, while wearing the suit. It can be a powerful tool if you use it right. So tell me, how does it feel?\r",
      "That suit can mimic the color, pattern, and even the surface texture of walls and floors. Kind of like procuring your own camo on sight, right?\r",
      "You've got it all wrong. We're not talking about lizards. This is OctoCamo. In other words, it's based on the camouflage capabilities of the octopus. Octopus are sometimes called the ninjas of the sea. They fool their enemies by mimicking not just the color of their surroundings, but also the shape of the terrain. That suit takes its cue from defensive deception found in nature. Besides, you may not have known this, but there's a snake that can change its body color, too. It's called the Kapuas mud snake. It's a poisonous reptile indigenous to the Kapuas River on the island of Borneo. Its coloring is normally a reddish-brown, but sometimes turns to white. So, snakes can sport disguises, too.\r",
      "All that does is create an optical illusion. It's no use against Gekko with their infrared sensors. OctoCamo, on the other hand, has micro peliter arrays that regulate the absorption and release of heat, harmonizing the wearer's body heat with any background IR radiation. Which means it can offer you at least some camouflage protection against enemy infrared sensors. With so many unmanned weapons these days, I'd expect it to outperform the old stealth camo. But if you start walking or running - or making a lot of noise - you'll risk getting spotted by the enemy. And get this - the suit also reduces the weight load on your body and amplifies muscle power. The inside lining sends a weak electric current through your body that stimulates phospholipid production inside your cells, improving circulation. That should make your LIFE Gauge (recover) more rapidly when you're hurt. In other words, Snake, it's a bit of a crutch...\r",
      "Snake, you know how that first gun you found stopped working? Well, from what I can tell, it looks like the problem was with the ammo.\r",
      "I'm betting it's because they were using cheap, local ammunition. The ammo probably triggered abnormal combustion, which excessively raised the pressure and caused the cartridges to stick in the chamber. It's a pretty rare phenomenon - I guess you got lucky.\r",
      "Look on the bright side - it means that there weren't any problems with the gun itself! I don't think it will happen again.\r",
      "Right. Strictly speaking, though, they're not Metal Gears.\r",
      "The Gears you've fought before were all basically designed and produced to serve as nuclear platforms. RAY was an exception to the rule, but even that was an anti-Metal Gear weapon designed to defeat all of the Metal Gear clones popping all over the world. Its value was still measured in terms of the framework of nuclear strategy. Its been 25 years since the end of the Cold War. We live in a world of regional conflict and asymmetric warfare - and it's getting worse every year. The age of the war economy is upon us. The value of Metal Gear as a weapon - the very concept itself - has changed with the times. You might even say it's evolved. Nowadays, a Metal Gear needs to be more than a nuclear attack platform. It needs to be adaptable, well-suited to fight in large numbers, traverse urban settings, and work alongside infantry. The Gekko were the answer. There are different types of Gekko designed for different missions, and not all of them are equipped with nuclear capabilities. So technically, they're not Metal Gears. Of course, there are still some of the old Metal Gears around - their primary job is to launch nuclear strikes. But these days, Gekko are the first name in bipedal war machines. They may have gotten smaller, but they're as ferocious as ever. Whatever you do, don't underestimate them.\r",
      "Snake, that circle that appears around your body is called a Threat Ring. It's a visual display of the sense you get from entities all around you. When you're crouching, or lying down, and concentrating, it forms a perfect circle. Your sense is represented as waves. The stronger the sense, the greater the wave. Hostile entities are displayed as colors. Get acquainted. It'll save your life. Oh, and one more thing. Your senses will suffer when your Psyche gets low. The ring will reflect that, too. Keep it in mind, okay?\r",
      "Snake, I'm sure you've noticed the dust bins used for trash collection in that area. I'll bet they're big enough to fit inside - it could come in handy if you need to stay out of sight until the coast is clear. To get inside a dust bin, stand in front of it and press the Action Button.\r",
      "Once you're inside, tilt the SIXAXIS Wireless Controller to sneak a peak outside. You can also launch a first person attack that way. When you're ready to get out, press the Action Button again. Snake, I know you already know this, but there's no point in hiding if the enemy sees you doing it. Make sure no one's watching.\r",
      "I've got some intel on the PMCs deployed in that area. They're a part of Praying Mantis Corporation, based out of the United Kingdom. It's one of the five largest PMCs in the world. Its business activity includes soldiers for hire, supply and logistics services, education and training for state armies... Everything you'd expect. During the Iraq War, Praying Mantis contracted with the US government to send large numbers of its soldiers into combat zones... Which is why the local regime opted to hire Praying Mantis, a UK-based company, and not their regular army to fight the rebels for them. They were buying their experience.\r",
      "Snake, I've said it a hundred times already, and I'll say it again - do not let the enemy see you! If the enemy catches sight of you, they'll dispatch reinforcements to your location. You're on your own out there - no backup. There's no place to run and no place to hide. That's why...\r",
      "OK, then. Just be extra careful and stay out of sight!\r",
      "Snake, where are you now?\r",
      "A trash can?\r",
      "How did it go, did you manage to hide?\r",
      "(huh) How can you tell?\r",
      "(eeugh!) Leftovers...\r",
      "(eeewwwgh!)\r",
      "(ohhgh! cough! gag!) Make sure you get the smell of them off you before coming back here!\r",
      "(ugh!) Seriously, doesn't it make you sick?\r",
      "(yaaugghh!) I can't even imagine! (eww!) You know, you might want to get out of there as soon as the coast is clear.\r",
      "No kidding.\r",
      "(ugh... I can't believe you're so abusive of the Mk. II...)\r",
      "(all the time I've put into this technology... agh...)rself...�thats the only thing�you think about...)\r",
      "Yeah, well, you better.\r",
      "Snake, the PMC soldiers are using ID guns.\r",
      "See how the word LOCKED appears in the Weapon List?\r",
      "ID guns are equipped with locks. As long as the lock is engaged, you can't pull the trigger.\r",
      "The locks are only disengaged when they recognize the nanomachine ID inside a soldier's body. Anyone not possessing nanomachines keyed to the System, or anyone who is keyed but not authorized to use that weapon, won't be able to pass the ID gun's verification process.\r",
      "I'm afraid not. You're not registered with the System. And it's not just weapons either. Vehicles, buildings - everything used for military purposes is secured with this ID control system. Without the proper IDs, it's impossible for PMCs or state armies to fight. Think of it as a soldier's dog tag, only at the nano level.\r",
      "For now, at least. But they might come in handy later on.\r",
      "Oh, you mean battlefield ads.\r",
      "On the street, anyway. It's what people are calling any ad having to do with the war economy. Privatizing the military has inevitably created intense competition for market share among the PMCs and defense industries. Everybody wants to expand their market - get a bigger piece of the pie. So they're churning out truckloads of ads, exactly like the ones we see everyday.\r",
      "It may seem that way, but the war economy is an enormous driving force in the world today. There are people whose livelihoods depend on those ads. Same goes for internet ads, TV commercials...\r",
      "I know. But that's reality.\r",
      "I created the Mk. II to provide you with mission support. It's outfitted with a full suite of support functions. It can transport weapons and items, assess your condition, conduct recon, provide map data, and analyze the state of battle.\r",
      "The Solid Eye is a multi-purpose goggle equipped with a variety of functions.\rIt has the same night vision capabilities as ENVGs, as wall as a monocular function. It can also display a wide range of data as called for by the situation at hand.\r",
      "It has the same night vision capabilities as ENVGs, as wall as a monocular function. It can also display a wide range of data as called for by the situation at hand.\rIt's capable of using visual cues to pull up target data on any soldiers and weapons within its field of vision.\r",
      "Say, for instance, the target is a soldier. The Solid Eye will display the soldier's physical and emotional state based on body temperature, heart rate, and even sweat secretion.\rYou can toggle the Solid Eye's functions in the Item window.\r",
      "Yeah. The Mk. II doesn't have to worry about damage from EM waves because it's a machine, and its surface area is small enough that cost isn't a problem. But (the) tradeoff being that it can be easily spotted by heat-seeking unmanned weapons. Keep that in mind, OK?\r",
      "How you linking that iPod, Snake? They say certain types of music can help relieve stress... If you're feeling run down, why not take a break? Listen to a few tunes...?\r",
      "Snake, the device you're wearing over your left eye is the Solid Eye.\r",
      "Tobidacid? Umm... OK. Never heard of it.\r",
      "I designed your radar exactly to your specifications, Snake. The baseline map, shown in the upper right of the screen, shows a visual representation of what your senses tell you, including sense you're not even conscious of. It compiles and amplifies data on surrounding temperature, humidity, sounds and smells. Think of it as a digital expression of the \"feel\" in your environment.\r",
      "That's one way of putting it, yeah. The stronger a \"feel\" is, the more vividly it shows up on the radar. But if you're somewhere with a high baseline - in the middle of a combat zone, say, or a panicking crowd - it's tougher to pick up that \"feel.\" Granted, you tend to stick out more when it's quiet around you, and it's easier to slip by unnoticed in a commotion. But it also makes you less alert to threats. Living organisms such as soldiers and moving objects like unmanned weapons give off strong \"feels,\" so they'll show up clearly on your radar. The radar also displays the strength of the ripples you yourself send out to others. The more you stick out, the bigger and brighter your radar presence will be. On the other hand, keeping quiet, staying stll, and using OctoCamo to blend in with the environment make your radar presence smaller... Indicating that you're less likely to be detected by the enemy.\r",
      "Those guys really know how to put on a show. I'm sure it was old and decrepit already, but I've never seen a building go down like that.\r",
      "The militias fighting against Praying Mantis are mercenaries belonging to a small-scale local PMC. Most of them are from around here, but it was more than ethnic ties that motivated them to pick up their guns. The country suffers from chronic high unemployment. There are a lot of households just barely scraping by. Kids that grow up in that environment don't have the chance to get a decent education, and there aren't enough opportunities for them to go abroad and find work, either. PMCs are one of the few options they have to earn a living.\r",
      "It's not a respectable trade by any measure. Still, for some reason I can't bring myself to condemn them for it. It's complicated, you know?\r",
      "During the Cold War, this region was the site of irregular proxy wars fought between the two superpowers. Now that it's over, the ethnic conflicts that were simmering beneath the surface have erupted into full-scale civil wars. Even today, the political situation is fragile. The land and its people have been ravaged and exhausted by years of constant warfare. With food scarce, and the economy near collapse, the country's barely being kept afloat by aid from developed nations. And despite all that, the current regime is still hiring PMCs to put down the anti-government militias, or \"terrorists\" as they call them. I know security is a big issue, but come on!\r",
      "That's how a lot of people would put it, yes.\r",
      "Yeah, I heard it too.\r",
      "Some kind of mercenaries hired by the PMCs?\r",
      "They may be small, but they bite. Hard.\r",
      "Sorry... Don't know the specifics. Give me some time. I'll see what I can dig up.\r",
      "Will do.\r",
      "I see you've found yourself an operator uniform. As long as you're wearing it, you can do what you need to do and the militiamen won't suspect a thing. It'll be a useful tool in certain situations. But be careful - hurt a fellow militiaman while wearing the uniform, and you'll blow your cover. Got it?\r",
      "Snake, is that...a drum? And what, pray tell do you intend to do with it? It's bigger than you are!\r",
      "Fit...? Oh, I got it!\r",
      "Say... that does sound pretty good. To hide inside a drum, simply equip it as an item. To roll, press the Crawl Button to lie down on your side, then move as you normally would. Nice find, Snake. No wonder they call you a professional procurer-on-site.\r",
      "Snake, I'm picking up a weak radio signal emitting from the infrared sensors placed throughout the building. My guess is they're set up so that whoever planted them - our informants, in other words - can monitor their operating status in real time. I strongly advise leaving those traps alone.\r",
      "Snake, are you watching Meryl's team?\r",
      "Sons of the Patriots... What a system.\r",
      "Then you'd better not make Meryl mad, for all our sakes.\r",
      "You gonna be all right? I mean, you two do have a history...\r",
      "Hey Snake, that emblem on Meryl's uniform... That's FOXHOUND, isn't it?\r",
      "I thought Meryl was with the 01 Unit. I mean, I know that she's attached to FOXHOUND, and all but still...\r",
      "Like disinformation?\r",
      "I wonder if that's really all it is. Maybe she's still got some lingering attachment...\r",
      "I meant to FOXHOUND.\r",
      "It's OK if Meryl wants to cling to the past... I just want her to be happy, that's all.\r",
      "Hey Snake, since when did you learn how to use CQC (Close Quarters Combat)?\r",
      "You had those skills all this time and never used them? Why?\r",
      "Big Boss?\r",
      "And then earlier this year the Pentagon declassifies Big Boss's file for some reason. All of a sudden his story is the stuff of pop culture - books, magazines, the net. And now people are taking another look at CQC.\r",
      "Big Boss's exploits as a Cold War secret agent back in the 60's have made him a legend.\r",
      "Is that the reason why you decided to CQC? Because it is no longer just his, anymore?\r",
      "Then you want to teach them the real thing, the way you learned from your fath-- I mean Big Boss.\r",
      "Ah, I get it. An eye for an eye. Well, maybe not quite. I reckon they'd lose more than an eye when going up against you.\r",
      "Snake, there are more differences between the militias and the PMCs than you may think. For one thing, the PMCs are flush with cash, so they usually have the latest gear.\r",
      "On top of that, they're running on the SOP System, which keeps them in constant contact with each other during battle. The militias, on the other hand, are little more than amateurs. Most haven't even had basic combat training. And their equipment is nothing to brag about either - they're just barely scraping by.\r",
      "Right. But the PMCs' weapons won't. You can steal their guns, but they'll most likely be locked and unusable. Remember that.\r",
      "Snake, these enhanced soldiers seem to be using some sort of device to climb to the walls.\r",
      "This is only a guess but I think their gloves and boots might have some mechanism that employs van der Waals force.\r",
      "It's a type of mutual interaction that occurs between two electrically neutral particles. Geckos use it to crawl up walls and across ceilings.\r",
      "Well, I read about an experiment about 10 years ago where they reportedly suspended an object weighing 100 grams using a 50-millimeter square piece of adhesive tape. Assuming the technology's advanced since then, I don't see why these guys couldn't be climbing all over the walls.\r",
      "You mean did he have the technology? He could have, yeah.\r",
      "Hey, when technology starts to test the limits of our imagination, what's the difference?\r",
      "Snake, remember how I told you the militias were basically amateurs?\r",
      "Right. The militias have hired operators working for them - You're disguised as one now. They make for pretty good commanders in battle.\r",
      "Maybe you haven't noticed because you're not actually working as one, but those operators are all over the place shouting out orders and giving signals. The militias' ability to organize themselves in battle largely depends on their presence. Heaven forbid one of those operators gets taken out. The chain of command would dissolve, along with any real combat effectiveness.\r",
      "Snake, I've been doing some research.\r",
      "(sigh) Look, those militias are generally made up of volunteers. But they're not just homegrown civvies who've been handed guns and told to fight. It looks like there's a locally based PMC - a small one, but it's there. So the militiamen you're seeing are most likely mercenaries hired by that PMC.\r",
      "This is the world we live in, Snake. It's kind of sad, isn't it?\r",
      "Yep, a BMP3. It's an old Soviet-designed IFV. It's not quite up to MBT defensive standards, but it's got enough armor to protect it against medium-caliber machine gun rounds. The militias could use it as a barricade against PMC gunfire. Use it to your advantage to help you proceed without having to face the PMCs.\r",
      "Looks like they just took out a BMP3.\r",
      "I'll say. But now there's one less shield for you to use. Watch out for stray bullets. The enemy's not too discriminating.\r",
      "Those things just wiped the floor with the militiamen...\r",
      "And now the wreckage is blocking the way. Snake, head straight for Liquid's camp.\r",
      "Are those Gekko on that truck? I always pictured Gekko as being these big, hulking things. But I guess they can fold up pretty small, too. Imagine that. I'll bet I could fit one through my front door if I tried... What do you think?\r",
      "Come on, you don't think I'm that weird. Do you?\r",
      "The low oxygen levels in this high-altitude mountainous area must be having a negative effect on the nanomachines. The PMCs are showing signs of unusually aggressive behavior. Watch your back, Snake.\r",
      "The rebel soldiers are in the plaza now, rounding up the prisoners they took in the last battle. Remember how I was telling you the PMCs are getting more and more prone to violence? Well, there's a fair chance this might not turn out so well for those rebels. Normally, I'd advise you to continue on with your objective, but I feel for those guys. Look, if you do decide to do the right thing, you'll have to take down those PMCs. It's your call, Snake.\r",
      "Looks like the rebels use that building as an armory.\r",
      "Before you move on, you should stock up on whatever you need. You've still got a long way to go.\r",
      "Snake, you know that the men and women in the rebel army were once regular soldiers in the national army. When the current regime seized power, they were either stripped of their ranks or left on their own accord. At any rate, the vast majority were in the army when the old regime implemented the SOP system.\r",
      "Exactly. But when the regime changed, the System expunged their IDs. That's why they can't use ID guns and fight with naked guns instead. On the other hand, it also means the government can't control the rebel's actions through the System. Or you can look at it another way - if you get a weapon from the rebels, there's no need to involve Drebin. You can use it as is.\r",
      "It sure is. Pieuvre Armement... Octopus Armaments. Why?\r",
      "Oh, yeah, I forgot - fluent in six languages. You know, I bet the octopus never saw it coming - someone using its limbs in a wartime advertisement.\r",
      "Sounds like something a procure-on-site expert would say.\r",
      "I'm kidding! I'm kidding!\r",
      "Snake, I see you found yourself a uniform from the old regime's army. It's just like the ones the rebels are wearing.\r",
      "The rebels are a heck of a lot less likely to shoot at you if you're wearing that uniform. Don't hesitate to put it on if you're feeling a little naked.\r",
      "Of course, you'll have to act the part, too. Don't forget to play nice.\r",
      "Snake, the guerrillas you liberated are probably well-versed in local geography. Following in their footsteps might be the fastest way to get where you need to go. Something to consider, anyway.\r",
      "Do you hear the birds, Snake?\r",
      "Good observation. Birds are nature's greatest security alarms. You should pay attention to how they sing and behave.\r",
      "Snake, that looks like a PMC-run prison camp. It's safe to assume that it's under extremely tight security. Any sign of prisoners?\r",
      "Don't tell me you're looking for weapons! Look, if I was in your shoes, I'd be using this opportunity to get the heck out of there.\r",
      "I'm not arguing. The decision's yours. Just be careful, that's all.\r",
      "You're now at a supply depot. It's a pretty run-down building, but part of it houses rebel prisoners, so don't expect security to be light.\r",
      "It's an armored bulldozer! They're gonna use it to break down the gate! Snake, that's your ticket inside. Wait for them to bring it down, and then charge on in.\r",
      "The lab where they're making Naomi do her research is somewhere inside. First things first: find a way to get inside that mansion. The rebels have pushed their way inside. This is the PMC's last stronghold. They'll stop at nothing to defend it. This battle's only going to get bloodier from here.\r",
      "That's only if you make use of the situation. Be ready for anything.\r",
      "That's a power station those PMCs are guarding. It's a key piece of infrastructure, so it's bound to be heavily defended. The rebels will surely see it as a high-value target. When those two groups get around to fighting, it's not going to be pretty. You've got a touch choice to make - follow the, or find your own way around.\r",
      "Until now the rebels have engaging the PMCs in an effort to capture the power station without damaging it. But looking at the way they've been fighting lately, I'm seeing a slight change in the rebel's strategy. They don't seem as concerned about keeping the facility intact.\r",
      "You could be right. They might even be trying to take out the power station now.\r",
      "The PMCs are likely expecting that, and will fight tooth and nail to defend the facility. Watch yourself out there.\r",
      "You mean those arm-like extensions? I think we've both got a pretty good idea - an offshoot of the battle suit Solidus wore.\r",
      "I doubt it. But I'll tell you one thing - they're in an entirely different league than the other PMCs. Even at medium range, those arms could deliver a nasty blow. Watch out for them, and keep your distance!\r",
      "Those spherical weapons Octopus is throwing - floating bombs, I guess you'd call them. They seem to be custom made. I've never seen anything like them.\r",
      "I think they're a type of MAV - micro air vehicles. Sort of like a distant cousin of the remote control missile.\r",
      "From what I've seen, there's a time lag between when they latch onto the target and detonation. You can use that lag to your advantage. Shake them off before they detonate. They don't seem too sticky, so rolling on the ground ought to do the trick. Or you could shoot them out of the air before they hit you. You can do it!\r",
      "Huh? What are you talking about? I didn't say anything!\r",
      "I'm telling you, I didn't call you. This is no time for jokes. You're supposed to be fighting Octopus! Come on!\r",
      "Hold on a minute, I didn't tell you to go anywhere!\r",
      "Now, now wait a second, Snake!\r",
      "Something's fishy here. Someone keeps calling you, but it's not me.\r",
      "Think about what she can do.\r",
      "It sure is possible. Watch out, Snake.\r",
      "Snake, you remember what Raiden was saying about scouting? Well, I did a little research of my own. The scouting he was talking about has a slightly different nuance than the reconnaissance scouting commonly referred to in the military.\r",
      "The word scout as he used it originally referred to Native American warriors. I, on the other hand, prefer to see the concept as being rooted in their attitudes toward nature. To know nature, study it, fear it, love it - to be one with it. As I understand it, the true essence of scouting lies in that way of life. The basis of scouting is awareness. Take, for example, a hunter tracking an animal. The hunter is surrounded by clues that tell him about his prey - footprints, bent grass, broken branches, shifts in the air... Things that are out of place. But they only speak to the tracker if he notices them. Some Native Americans tribes have long been able to detect even the most minute details because they develop those senses from early childhood by living in nature. They use all five of their senses, placing great importance on sensing through the skin, and sometimes go shirtless, even in winter. It's said there are many different ways to feel the same wind. These things may seem foreign to you and I, but for them it's a way of life.\r",
      "Yeah, me too. Maybe Raiden's reached a level of enlightenment we haven't.\r",
      "An explosive trap! If you'd triggered it, not only would you have sustained damage, the sound would have put the enemy on alert. Watch your step.\r",
      "Snake, the MK.II's microphone is picking something up... Sounds like a helicopter rotor. Maybe there's a heliport nearby? I'm pretty sure you've reached the forest's edge, Snake. The exit to the heliport should be close by. Find it.\r",
      "Dr. Madnar offered Sunny and Naomi his full support. He's going to offer them a dialysis machine no charge.\r",
      "I hear you saved the doctor and his little girl back in Outer Heaven.\r",
      "Always good to help others. That reminds me: Madnar wanted me to tell you his daughter Ellen is married now. Kids, too. Three of them. And one more thing. He told me to tell you he's... sorry.\r",
      "It all started six months ago. An American company was planning an oil pipeline, and the current pro-US government approved PMC units to be stationed in the country to provide \"security\" during construction. This brought tensions between the government and the anti-US opposition to a boiling point. And then a riot - presumably instigated by the opposition - broke out near the US embassy... The PMCs suppressed the riot, placing their government directly into Washington's front pocket. Almost overnight, they opened up this country to a large-scale hunt down of the resistance. And now, the entire transportation network has been shut down, with checkpoints everywhere. That's the official story, anyway.\r",
      "The riot that the opposition supposedly started? I suspect it was all part of a conspiracy. The units executing the actual operation are part of Liquid's own PMC, and the resistance group they're trying to flush out is led by Big Mama. The resistance also happens to have Big Boss's body in its possession. Seems as though Liquid was the one pulling the strings. He must have incited the riot to frame Big Mama, creating a scenario that allowed him to bring the big guns to recover that body. I doubt politics has anything to do with any of this.\r",
      "t does. Now Snake, you know the drill - we need to get to Big Mama before they do.\r",
      "Damn it! We've lost the van!\r",
      "We'll just have to head to the rendezvous point and pray that the van is safe.\r",
      "Those Sliders will sometimes leave her side and operate independently... Most likely acting as a remote scouting platform. If you see a Slider flying on its own, don't hesitate to shoot it down. That should reduce the Beast's situation awareness and tilt the odds in your favor.\r",
      "Snake, those Sliders are equipped with searchlights. Don't get caught in the beam, or they'll spot you right away!\r",
      "Snake, it seems as though the angrier Raven becomes, the shorter her Vernier bursts get. I'm seeing a correlation between the emotion data I'm getting through the Solid Eye and the length of time she uses the Vernier.\r",
      "Well, after the Vernier fires for a certain period of time, it has to be shut down for a while so it can cool off.\r",
      "Good analogy. Now, this is only a guess, but I'm thinking that Raven tends to lose control of herself when angered. Normally, she'd try to avoid overheating the Vernier, but get her riled up, and she seems to forget all about that.\r",
      "Necessitating longer and more frequent cool-down periods.\r",
      "Exactly! Keep up your attack, but try to provoke her into getting mad - that should give you a fighting chance.\r",
      "I've been analyzing Raven's emotional data. She seems to get even more enraged when she's attacked or loses a Slider. That fury gradually cools down over time. So keep a steady stream of attacks to sustain that rage. Or shoot down a lot of her Sliders. Either way should do the trick!\r",
      "Big Boss's body has fallen into Liquid's clutches. We can't let him get his hands on REX, too. We have to get to the underground escape route where REX is stored before they do. I'm setting your radar to point towards the target. Check it if you need to get your bearings. Shadow Moses is an uninhabited ruin now. There aren't any human soldiers stationed here, but I am picking up unmanned machines. Judging by their signature, they're probably a part of Liquid's army. I know you're getting pretty used to fighting them by now, but don't let your guard down.\r",
      "Look, there's the tank hangar. It sure brings back memories, doesn't it? I know it's all ancient history by now, but do you remember how you snuck into the hanger [sic] last time? I seem to remember the front hangar door being shut back then because of a blizzard just like this one.\r",
      "Well, now you've got three ways to get in. Lucky you!\r",
      "The Gekko appeared to be designed for high mobility - even in cramped urban environments like this one.\r",
      "Their legs' main drive uses artificial muscle tissue genetically engineered from the cloned ES cells of ungulate embryos. This gives them quick respose times and a high output-to-weight ratio. Basically, the Gekko have the legs of a star athlete - that's what makes them so agile. But it's also their weak point. Those things may have an amazingly high output, but they're also deployed in limited indoor search-and-destroy operations. So there's a limit to how heavy they can make the frames. Otherwise, they'd drop right through the floor. To keep its weight down, the Gekko's defensive armor is concentrated on the head, where the central computer is housed. The legs aren't defenseless, but by comparion, they're a pretty soft target. In other words...\r",
      "Exactly! Keep it in mind - it could save your life.\r",
      "It looks like they haven't deployed any security at the heliport. But that doesn't mean there won't be any later on. Stay alert.\r",
      "Keep going north and enter the tank hangar. I'll let you decide the best COA (course of action).\r",
      "Taking the duct, eh? Still remember where the exit is?\r",
      "Friends?\r",
      "Little? Furry?\r",
      "Ah, the little three-legged - well, three-armed machine. Actually, I was in touch with Nastasha just recently. She told me about a rumor making its way around the military analyst community.\r",
      "Gekko are being deployed in more and more urban counterterrorism operations. In the process, they've encountered a number of problems. One of them is size and weight. Compared to other types of armored weapons, Gekko are relatively small and light, but they're still a bit too big to be effective in indoor search and combat operations. So the manufacturer, AT Corp, developed a new, smaller UGV based on the Gekko archetype for just that kind of mission. And the latest word is they're about to start field testing.\r",
      "More than likely. That's all the information I have. The very existence of these things is still top secret.\r",
      "I doubt they're heavily armed, but remember these things are designed to support Gekko during indoor combat. Best to assume they're capable of some form of attack.\r",
      "True, but that doesn't mean you can take them lightly. Be careful, Snake.\r",
      "Snake, what are you doing in there?\r",
      "Who knows, maybe you'll find something in there again?\r",
      "OK. Just remember we need to get a move on.\r",
      "That Gekko looks as though its drive has gone completely dead. I wonder if it is some sort of mechanical problem... Nevermind that, Snake. No time for dead lizards. Keep moving.\r",
      "Whoa, what the hell was that? That Gekko must have been in hibernation mode or something. One minute it looks dead, and then... Bam!\r",
      "Seriously, though, who'd have known Gekko had that kind of operational mode?\r",
      "From now on, you'd better keep both eyes on those Gekko. You don't want to get fooled like that again.\r",
      "This snow just won't quit, will it? Can't see a thing in this whiteout. Visibility is practically zero. You need to be especially vigilant for enemy patrols. Make good use of your OctoCamo to help you get through.\r",
      "Hey Snake, something I've been meaning to ask you. That canyon... Isn't that where you demolished Raven's tank? How'd you do it, anyway?\r",
      "That's it? You didn't use an anti-tank missile or something?\r",
      "You're technique is kind of - how to put this - archaic when it comes to fighting tanks. Honestly, I don't think it'd work on today's main battle tanks.\r",
      "You know, I asked an active-duty Army officer once - if an infantryman had to take on a tank one-on-one, how should he do it?\r",
      "\"Don't.\" He swore there's no way in hell a single infantryman could take down a tank by himself.\r",
      "I always suspected there was a little something crazy about you, Snake. But hearing that story... Now I know it. You're nuts! Single-handedly taking out a tank? That's crazy! You're insane!\r",
      "Yes! You're the toughest, craziest, most hardcore badass on the planet. You're... the shit!\r",
      "Everything looks exactly like I remember it. Except for that wall way in back, anyway. I still can't believe how much damage you caused in such a small space.\r",
      "Didn't make much of a bang, huh?\r",
      "You're right. The wiring past the switch circuits could still be live.\r",
      "No need to worry. As long as you don't turn the current back on.\r",
      "This brings back memories. My colleagues and I used to work in these cubicles. We were all brilliant engineers - the best of the best. And we were close, too. Like family. We used to play pranks on each other all the time. Like on this one girl's birthday, we stuffed her cubicle completely full of balloons. Or this one guy when he got married - when he came back from his honeymoon, he found his workstation had been hollowed out and its guts replaced with jellybeans!\r",
      "It was! But, all that time, my colleagues and I, we were building REX. Here we are, messing around in our cubicles all day like giddy grad students, and what do we end up with? A weapon of mass destruction. Not exactly the sort of thing to look back on and laugh, is it?\r",
      "Yeah, you're right. You can count on me. We're partners, after all.\r",
      "It's good to be here, Snake.\r",
      "I remember this place. After you beat the Cyborg Ninja, I came out into the hallway and all I saw was a sea of blood. The air was filled with this sickly sweet smell... I remember thinking, \"this must be what hell is like.\" My mind couldn't even process what I was seeing at first. Anyways... Keep following that hallway to the north and you'll reach my lab.\r",
      "Do you have a weapon that would work against those Gekko?\r",
      "OK, great. Use it to get them out of the way!\r",
      "Remember when we first met? I hate to bring back painful memories, but remember how you got shocked in this hallway before you first came to my office?\r",
      "Well, it wasn't there at first, obviously. They installed it when Liquid took the place over.\r",
      "Exactly. Say, didn't you destroy the switchboard to the current?\r",
      "Well, I just checked it out over the LAN, and it looks like those circuits are still getting power...\r",
      "Maybe you could use the MK. III to turn the current in the floor on again. The Gekko probably have decent surge protection on their electronic components, but a good, long high-voltage bath just might fry their organic parts. Go ahead and send the MK. III over to the switchboard. It's worth a shot.\r",
      "The Mk. III has to stay near the door until I've opened it, and it can't use stealth camo. It's only a matter of time before the Gekko find it.\r",
      "It's true - stealth doesn't do much against the Gekko's sensor suite. But it's better than nothing. Compared to full visibility, the probability of detection is slightly lower.\r",
      "Why? Because I have to use the Mk. III's manipulator to open the door, that's why.\r",
      "Once the Mk. III activates its stealth camo, the entire machine becomes transparent, including the manipulator.\r",
      "(sigh) How easy do you think it would be for you to eat a meal, clean your gun, if you couldn't see your own hands?\r",
      "Look, Snake, it doesn't take a genius to figure out the Mk. III's not gonna survive a run in with those Gekko. Don't let them get close to it until I've opened the door.\r",
      "Look at the Gekko - See the milliwave radar antenna up top? And the intercepting shot launcher on the upper part of its leg? That's the active defense system. Knock out the sensor, and you should be able to disable it. Aim for the antenna.\r",
      "The comm towers... This is where you fought Liquid's Hind D.\r",
      "But you still managed to shoot down his gunship. Up until then, I'd heard that even with a MANPADS, going one on one against an attack chopper was an act of suicide. I thought only Hollywood action stars did that kind of thing. But you made it look easy.\r",
      "Really? But you were all like, \"Oh, I had to take out that helicopter.\" Real cool. Like... like it was nothing.\r",
      "Yeah, you're right, Snake.\r",
      "Infrared, maybe...? No, you're wearing OctoCamo, it wouldn't be able to read you. Snake, do you see a pattern in her attacks? Anything that gives you a hint?\r",
      "Which means...\r",
      "Amazing! Tracking you in this wind - just by your scent?\r",
      "Then what do we do? OctoCamo doesn't do anything to mask your scent.\r",
      "Can you do it?\r",
      "Ok, then. Good luck, Snake.\r",
      "All that power... But still small enough for the Beast to carry. And that noise it makes when it charges... Snake, do you remember the weapon Fortune had?\r",
      "I don't want to be conspiratorial, but it seems like something's behind this. Maybe it's just fate? Nevermind, you've got to tame that beast!\r",
      "When the rail gun begins to charge, the enhanced soldiers in its line of fire all simultaneously lower their posture.\r",
      "Whatever the case, they do seem to be highly coordinated.\r",
      "Don't underestimate them, Snake.\r",
      "Hear that, Snake?\r",
      "Her family... It must be tough for them in this environment with all the people gone...\r",
      "You sure about that?\r",
      "Ok. If you say so.\r",
      "Huh? ... Oh wait! We're on PlayStation 3! It's a Blu-ray disc. Dual-layered too - no need to swap.\r",
      "The rolling facility is a long, narrow space that stretches south to north. The southern half houses the rollers, while the northern half is used to cool the finished steel sheets. The drainage duct lies beyond that. Head for that drainage duct.\r",
      "Careful, Snake. This place is crawling with Gekko and Dwarf Gekko.\r",
      "How do you figure?\r",
      "Figures... Snake, don't let him get to you. You've got to get through there alive.\r",
      "Snake, I went ahead and remotely sent the lift used to bring REX up to the supply tunnel. So then... All aboard!\r",
      "That's it! Remember what Naomi said after Raiden fought him in South America? The nanomachines in his body are helping him heal at an accelerated rate.\r",
      "I don't know... But for now, just give him everything you've got!.\r",
      "Damn it! It looks like conventional attacks won't be enough after all.\r",
      "Snake, there's only one option let - find some way to stop his nanomachines from working. It could be the silver bullet we're looking for.\r",
      "Think, Snake. There must be a way.\r",
      "I've got it! Naomi's syringe! Those drugs suppress nanomachine activity.\r",
      "It ought to work on the nanomachines in Vamp's body, too - stop his Life from recovering so fast. Use Naomi's syringe to pump him full of the drugs!\r",
      "You've got to buy some time until my check of REX is complete! These Gekko are rigged to blow themselves up. You need to destroy the frame completely with a powerful weapon before they finish their self-destruct sequence! Snake, that rail gun Wolf was using...\r",
      "Good. That should give you more than enough power. Use it to shoot the Gekko!\r",
      "I hate to say it, but I think Liquid's got the advantage when it comes to piloting Metal Gear. After all, he's had RAY in his hands for quite some time now. But not to worry! I was REX's lead designer, and I'm here to support you. I've installed an emulator of REX's CPU and DSP on Gaudi. We'll run it in parallel with REX's processors to enable distributed processing of control tasks. It'll give us a big boost in throughput, which should make REX as fast and agile as RAY.\r",
      "It's OK, Snake. I know you can win this!\r",
      "Do me a favor, Snake. Get as close to RAY as you can.\r",
      "I created a special program back when I was designing REX. I thought it might come in handy here.\r",
      "REX is armed with powerful self-defense systems - missiles, laser - designed to protect it during solo ops overseas. But some of us engineers were worried about what would happen if it found itself in a close-range shootout. We got to thinking... Why not use REX's tough shell as a weapon in itself? In other words, why not make it into a street fighter? The program was completed and we got fantastic results on a supercomputer simulation, but the project was shelved before we could make our pitch. Didn't fit in with military regulations. But...\r",
      "I, (uh) went ahead and installed the program anyway. You know... Secretly.\r",
      "I just rechecked the program on Gaudi's simulator. (and) As far as I can tell, it should work just fine!\r",
      "The project is still in alpha, so its low on flexibility and only gives results in specific cases. I'll give you a signal when the conditions are right to activate it. When you see the signal, just press the Action Button and RAY won't even know what hit it. But first you have to get close to RAY.\r",
      "All right, that's what I like to hear!\r",
      "Snake, the catapult malfunctioned when it launched Meryl. She landed some distance away from you.\r",
      "There's no time to rendezvous with them. You'll each have to make your own way to the server room. I'll be following you with the Mk.III. I can't be there to watch your back in person, but I'm with you all the way. Good luck, Snake!\r",
      "The soldiers above decks are having a shootout with the enemy on your end. It's a total war zone.\r",
      "For now, at least. The Missouri's protected by some pretty thick armor.\r",
      "Yeah, I know. Same goes for you, too, Snake. Don't end up like Admiral Nelson.\r",
      "That's the spirit, Snake.\r",
      "Liquid had dispatched armor-enhanced troops from his personal army to that area. You do not want to get surrounded by them. Make sure they don't see you, or - if you do engage - try and take them out one at a time.\r",
      "You can't move? What the heck did you... Oh, Snake, did you set the controller number to something other than 1?\r",
      "Let me guess - you thought back to your battle with Psycho Mantis and figured that the same tactic would actually work again, right?\r",
      "Nice try, Snake. But this time the controller number has to be 1, or else you can't control your actions.\r",
      "Don't look at me! I'm sorry, but it's simply not going to work this time around.\r",
      "Snake, remember how Psycho Mantis controlled Meryl using telepathy? Well, I'm thinking this thing does it by manipulating the nanomachines inside a target's body, forcing them to secrete opioids and sending them into hypoesthesia. In other words, she puts them into a sleepwalking state and controls their muscle systems directly.\r",
      "My guess? A hologram - meant to intimidate people. Having some freaky thing like that suddenly pop up in front of you is enough to make anybody jump.\r",
      "The control signal for the nanomachines must be embedded in the laser used to create the hologram. That's probably why Mantis can't control you unless you touch it.\r",
      "Same concept. Didn't you ever do that experiment in high school where you attach electrodes to a dead frog's leg to make it twitch? The nanomachines are capable of storing an electric charge. It's entirely possible that Mantis is using that electricity to make muscles contract. If she really is controlling people through their nanomachines, you know a way to counter that, right? Give it a try.\r",
      "Sorry, nothing I can think of right now. There must be some way though...\r",
      "I've got an idea. What if you used those puppets to turn the tables on the Beast - control her instead?\r",
      "It's worth a try, at least. First select one in the item window. Then press the Attack Button to shoot out a ghost just like a weapon. If the ghost hits its target, it's show time! Got all that, Snake? Go on, take her for a spin.\r",
      "When the Beast's victims take damage or get knocked out, it looks like they're temporarily freed from its control. Maybe because the shock of the attack creates a disturbance in the nanomachine interface...? But then knocking them out wouldn't, or would it? Well, anyway, whatever the reason, it's something that can work to your advantage. Don't hesistate to use it. Just don't get carried away and kill any of your comrades, OK? If you can knock them out or put them to sleep, all the better.\r"

Don't you think it's funny that even though two years have gone by since the incident, they haven't managed to clean up all the crude oil? Of course, the media doesn't report that kind of thing. I think they're having fresh shipments of crude oil brought in to replace the stuff they've cleaned up. The story you were told about toxic chemicals being released if the plant were blown up also seems pretty fishy. I don't think its actually true. Information is being suppressed on a huge scale. These guys seem to think that the new Metal Gear is worth all the effort and money they're spending on it.\r",

      "Emma: Don't lie to me! The pool... You could never look at me in the eye after the accident! You took the easy way out, so you wouldn't have to face me! That way, you could avoid responsibility every day... You ran... you ran away so you wouldn't have to face the pain!\rOtacon: No... that's not why I left...\r",
      "Otacon: That's not true. I left the house because...\rEmma: You're a criminal! Just like me!\r",
      "Otacon: But...\rEmma: Look at what you're doing now... You're nothing but a cracker.\r",

      "Emma: Up to now, scientists have continued to be active participants in war. What's your opinion?\rOtacon: There's no doubt that war has been an ideal event that fuels the progress of science. But therein lies the trap... We scientists must establish some sort of work ethic. It's a tragedy that both the government and the military act as sponsors to modern science.\r",

Incidentally, the set you're using is a fourth-generation model.\r",
      "I see you're wearing body armor. That's a great way to minimize damage. Your body armor is interwoven with a special fiber made from high-performance polymer materials. The special fiber tangles around a bullet to cushion and spread out the impact to keep damage at a minimum. Bear in mind that the armor just reduces damage. It doesn't eliminate it.\r",

      "Stand in front of it, press the Action Button. Got it.\r",

      "Yeah, I did like you said.\r",

      "Battlefield ads? Is that what they're called...\r",
      "But war is not something you can just write off.\r",
      "The world's gone mad, and us with it.\r",
      "Tell me something, Otacon. What possessed you to name it Metal Gear Mk. II?\r",
      "It's capable of using visual cues to pull up target data on any soldiers and weapons within its field of vision.\rSay, for instance, the target is a soldier. The Solid Eye will display the soldier's physical and emotional state based on body temperature, heart rate, and even sweat secretion.\r",
      "Otacon, you gave the Mk. II stealth capability?\r",
      "3D glasses, huh? I remember having this toy pair called Tobidacid back when I was a kid...\r",
      "The \"feel\"? You mean my close-range senses?\r",

      "Otacon...\r",
      "A special-forces unit with advanced gear... Who are they?\r",
      "Right. One of his men picked up some pieces. That must be what they had in front of them - looked the same as the one that bombed that building.\r",
      "Removing a lock on a gun...? Otacon, can they really do that?\r",
      "Let me know if you find anything.\r",
      "That's the point, Otacon. It has to be at least this size. How else am I going to fit?\r",
      "If the enemy is after me, I can hide inside until they're gone. And, unlike a cardboard box, in a pinch, I can roll into a quick getaway.\r",
      "Yeah, they're incredible. The best of the best in Special Forces are pretty deadly, but Meryl's team is even better than that. They're like a well-oiled machine.\r",
      "I'll tell you one thing - I'm glad they're on our side.\r",
      "No kidding.\r",
      ".....\r",
      "Yep.\r",
      "Covert Special Forces units do this kind of thing all the time. They use emblems that don't mean anything, like skulls and stuff.\r",
      "Something like that.\r",
      "You think so?\r",
      "I knew that.\r",
      "I got the training back when I was in FOXHOUND, but I never used it in actual combat.\r",
      "The man who taught me was my former commander in FOXHOUND.\r",
      "Never felt right using the technique learned from a man who'd betray his unit. Thinking back, CQC as a concept was (way) ahead of its time. No one was using it yet - not the Green Berets or the SEALS or the CIA Paramilitaries...\r",
      "The war criminal, reinvented as a hero.\r",
      "The less people know about the truth, the more they can fantasize.\r",
      "The CQC soldiers are using nowadays is a pale imitation. They're learning from reading about it. I learned from doing, and there's a world of difference.\r",
      "That's not it, either. Some things aren't meant to be passed on to future generations. When some guy comes at me using that cookie cutter imitation of CQC, my body just reacts naturally. That's all.\r",
      "Looks that way. Weapons systems, combat suits, tactical vests, communications equipment... All the latest toys.\r",
      "Their weapons don't seem to be controlled by the System. The ones I've picked up work for me just fine.\r",
      "Doesn't look like they have spikes or suction cups.\r",
      "Uh huh...\r",
      "That kind of Gecko... But those things are a hell of a lot lighter than a human.\r",
      "Otacon, what about Vamp? How he ran up that support pillar in the Big Shell? You think that's how he did it?\r",
      "So it wasn't that he had some freak, supernatural powers.\r",
      "Yeah. From what I've seen, though, they're holding their own. Not quite ready to lie down and give up, at least.\r",
      "(grunt)\r",
      "No...\r",
      "(hmph) So you've got PMCs, led by PMCs, fighting PMCs... A real showcase for the war economy.\r",
      "Otacon, looks like the militias have got themselves an armored tank.\r",
      "It was one of those PMC tankbusters. Nice piece of work.\r",
      "They're not getting me on a cheap kill. I'll watch my back.\r",

      "You can tell that much from blood?\r",
      "(Hmmm...) Kind of a flip side to soldier genes.\r",
      "What's up, doc?\r",
      "Will do. Rose, how do I keep my Psyche from going down? Isn't there some way to develop resistance to stress?\r",
      "Recognize it... (hmm)\r",
      "Just here for my check-up.\r",
      "Got it.\r",
      "Catharsis? Sure.\r",

      "Got it.\r",
      "All right.\r",
      "Rose.\r",
      "Got it.\r",
      "Yeah, like trauma pads... Body armor woven from high-tensile fibers can stop bullets and shrapnel from penetrating, but in the end it's no more than a piece of cloth. It does nothing to stop the bullet's kinetic energy from being transferred to the wearer's soft tissue. You're lucky if [you] get off with just bruises. More than likely you're left with a few fractures...broken bones. That's why you wear trauma pads - to absorb the shock so it does as little damage as possible. They make all kinds of them. Some have steel plates designed to diffuse the shock of impact over a wide area. Others use shock-absorbing gels to convert kinetic energy into heat.\r",

      "Got it.\r",
      "As much as anyone else. I like to have a good time.\r",

      "(hm) Thanks for the tip.\r",
      "What do you have for me, Rose?\r",
      "Got it.\r",
      "What?\r",
      "(ahhh...) I've heard something like that before. A guy from the New Zealand SAS told me about it. When it's cold outside but too dangerous to build a fire, they took a picture of a fire instead. Said it made their bodies feel warmer.\r",
      "Kind of like you?\r",
      "I need a Psyche check.\r",
      "Will do.\r",
      "Right. An accurate evaluation of your opponent before you take action.\r",
      "I need an update on my Psyche.\r",
      "Got it.\r",
      "No kidding? And here I thought it was all smoke and mirrors.\r",
      "Super.\r",
      "Got it.\r",
      "Right.\r",
      "Yeah, she's been like that as long as I've known her. Any idea why?\r",
      "Stress? Sunny chooses not to go outside. It's what she wants.\r",
      "(huungh) I know.\r",
      "Look, we're only trying to do what Sunny wants. What do you want me to do?\r",
      "Yeah, sure.\r",
      "Super.\r",
      "Yeah. I'm fine.\r",
      "What?\r",
      "Oh, you mean the plant.\r",
      "Rose, I keep getting these visions of being stabbed to death whenever I see a knife. It's not quite d�j� vu, but just seeing one of the [those] things gives me a feeling like I'm being stabbed.\r",
      "So, my subconscious is warning me not to get gutted?\r",
      "It wasn't real high on my to-do list, anyway.\r",
      "No, it's good advice - I think it's helping.\r",
      "Rose, something's going on. I've been getting this weird feeling. Like I died once already. And it was from a gunshot... Just seeing an enemy carrying a gun has been putting me on edge.\r",
      "I'd tell him not to get himself - or me - killed.\r",
      "Ah, I see. Get back to the basics. Use the right stick to look for the enemy, move cautiously, and stay out of sight. I should be start listening to my other \"me\"...\r",
      "Rose, I know it sounds weird, but I can't shake this feeling that I've drowned before.\r",
      "Well, more like I have this gut feeling, like I died underwater at some point.\r",
      "I'm not afraid of anything.\r",
      "Except, now it feels like I'm more aware than ever of drowning. I'm paying more attention to my O2 Gauge, and coming up for air more regularly.\r",
      "You're right. No more risky underwater maneuvers for me.\r",
      "That'd be nice. Anyway, sorry to bother you.\r",
      "Rose, I feel kind of dumb bringing this up, but...\r",
      "You see, I... I died recently.\r",
      "Well, I can't shake the feeling that I've died before. I can't quite describe the sensation. It's like I died and then restarted the mission. I also get the sense I'm watching myself from a distance... Over my own shoulder...\r",
      "Meaning...?\r",
      "In the past... What do you think it is?\r",
      "What do you mean by \"warning?\"\r",
      "So I should what? Act carefully? Avoid death?\r",
      "I'll be more careful. Thanks.\r",
      "Rose, you there? There's something I want to ask you...\r",
      "Hurt? What are you talking about?\r",
      "What's the matter?\r",
      "Relax. I'm alive. Death by explosion, huh? It's true, one blast and I'm off to meet my maker.\r",
      "Yeah, I'll make a point of it. Thanks for looking out for me, Rose.\r",
      "What do you have for me, Rose?\r",
      "(hmm) Good.\r",
      "But you never know what kind of equipment I'll need handy.\r",
      "What's up, doc?\r",
      "Hah...\r",
      "Got an update for me?\r",
      "Glad to hear it.\r",
      "This place is full of stuff I can use.\r",
      "Hold on. You're saying they got nanomachines in their bodies?\r",
      "Nice. I'll have to remember that.\r",
      "The PMC the regime hired is French, isn't it?\r",
      "This battlefield ad I'm looking at... It's written in French. \"Les tentacules de la pieuvre pour votre guerre!\" Means something like, \"Arms of the octopus. Arms for your war!\"\r",
      "You use what you can. That's what we humans do.\r",
      "Is that so, Otacon?\r",
      "Yeah. Just my size, too.\r",
      "I'll do that.\r",
      "Don't worry, I'll behave.\r",
      "Yeah. I noticed a change in their song a while back... They're trying to warn other birds about some kind of disturbance. There must be people coming. If they get too close, the birds will stop calling and fly away.\r",
      "Yeah, I saw some guys who fit the bill. Otacon, with security like this, you'd think there'd be an arms locker or something, wouldn't you?\r",
      "But I have to do what's best given the circumstances.\r",
      "The bloodier, the better - for me, at least.\r",
      "Super.\r",
      "Great. Thanks.\r",
      "Yeah, you told me about that.\r",
      "Hey, I don't let my mental state effect my combat efficiency.\r",
      "Could have fooled me.\r",
      "All right. All right.\r",
      "What's up, doc?\r",
      "All right then.\r",
      "Ice cream. Tasty.\r",
      "Got an update for me?\r",
      "Got it.\r",
      "Colonel? We're in the middle of something here.\r",
      "Of course I have.\r",
      "Really. That's wonderful.\r",
      "All right... So what's your point?\r",
      "Colonel, what exactly are you...?\r",
      "No kidding. Wait a minute. Rose, who does the cooking at your house?\r",
      "Nothing, nevermind. Colonel?\r",
      "My sympathies.\r",
      "Super.\r",
      "Great. Thanks.\r",
      "Not this again...\r",
      "Yeah?\r",
      "It... Yeah.\r",
      "Yeah, I guess you're right.\r",
      "Well, this was originally their land. Even if the infrastructure takes a few hits, as long as they regain control, they can always rebuild later. Right now, their top priority is thinning the PMCs' ranks. At least, that's what it looks like from here.\r",
      "Take it out... Yeah. Render the switchboard inoperative and you'll shut the whole place down.\r",
      "Will do.\r",
      "Otacon, doesn't that enhancement suit remind you of anything?\r",
      "You thinks the BBs are connected to him somehow?\r",
      "Will do.\r",
      "No kidding. They get a bead on me and hone right in. Hard to shake 'em off.\r",
      "How do I stop them?\r",
      "At this point, no matter what you say to her, she'll only respond one way.\r",
      "You mean she's not having a good time out here?\r",
      "Otacon, what's wrong? Why are you calling me over there?\r",
      "It was you.\r",
      "I... Hey, Otacon--!\r",
      "Otacon! What the hell were you thinking, sending me over there?\r",
      "Thanks a lot. I just got nailed by a trap. Are you trying to get me killed?\r",
      "Octopus!\r",
      "It's a fake!\r",
      "Makes sense. I kind of got that feeling from the way he was talking.\r",
      "Little too abstract for me.\r",
      "Maybe. Something to ask him next time our paths cross.\r",
      "So if I'm wearing the Solid Eye and get to close, it'll give away my position.\r",
      "Hmm. Good to hear.\r",
      "Yeah. Yeah... I remember that.\r",
      "Yeah.\r",
      "Otacon, it's like a PMC convention here.\r",
      ".....\r",
      "Sounds like Liquid all right.\r",
      "My sentiments exactly.\r",
      "Yeah. And to top it off, there are some monster crows flying around here. Looks like the tourists have been feeding these guys - they're pretty damn big.\r",
      "That's part of the thrill.\r",
      "I've heard of \"runner's high.\"\r",
      "Right. I've heard of that.\r",
      "Sounds like a combat high, kind of wish I wasn't riding combat shotgun, though.\r",
      "And?\r",
      "Like firing a machine gun in bursts to avoid burning out the barrel.\r",
      "I get it. The Vernier keeps getting hotter and hotter...\r",
      "So, the greater her rage, the less she can fly.\r",
      "Yeah, there's two ducts that lead inside, an upper and a lower one. I picked one and used it to sneak in.\r",
      "Yeah, you're telling me.\r",
      "Targeting their legs should at least slow them down, right?\r",
      "Yeah, I'll be fine. Way I remember it, these ducts aren't that complicated. And my old friends are still here to show me the way. I won't get lost.\r",
      "Friends. Little, furry ones.\r",
      "Nevermind.\r",
      "We've got another weird one here, Otacon.\r",
      "Nastasha Romanenko... And?\r",
      "And that's what these things are?\r",
      "Pint-sized Gekko, huh? Dwarf Gekko...\r",
      "Maybe so, but they're still just machines.\r",
      "Just reminiscing. Last time I was here there was this nice stash of weapons and items.\r",
      "Maybe.\r",
      "Right. I'll be done here in a sec.\r",
      "Tell me about it. I think I almost had a heart attack.\r",
      "Whoever made 'em must've been a real bastard.\r",

      "Well, that's how I did it. What do you want me to say?\r",
      "And what was his answer?\r",
      "Interesting.\r",
      "Otacon, is this your idea of a compliment?\r",
      "The switchboard - nailed it with a remote-control missile to shut down the electric current in the floor. The guidance system in those things takes up so much space it hardly leaves any room for explosives.\r",
      "Hardly. Switchboard's still intact.\r",
      "Wait a minute... I'm not going to get shocked if I walk on this floor, am I?\r",
      "Sounds...little like a blast.\r",
      "You obsess over the past too much. It's a bad habit. Come on, I need directions here. That's your job, right? To support me?\r",
      "Good to have you with me, partner.\r",
      "Sure do.\r",
      "Yeah, blew me halfway across the room. Come to think of it, why have a high-voltage current running through the floor in a research facility? Isn't that... Dangerous?\r",
      "To keep you from escaping... So you'd have to finish REX.\r",
      "With a remote controlled missile, yeah.\r",
      "What? That would mean...\r",
      "No stealth? So what? I thought it didn't work on the Gekko anyway.\r",
      "So if it's even a little bit better being invisible than not, why turn off the stealth?\r",
      "I don't get it.\r",
      "Yeah... So?\r",
      "I got it.\r",
      "Ok, no problem. I'm on it.\r",
      "Not exactly. Things are just a little sticky right now. I need to distract the enemy's attention until the MK. III gets the door open.\r",
      "That was a tough scrape.\r",
      "I just told you it wasn't that easy.\r",
      "All right, enough chit-chat. Let's get going. We've got a long way to go to REX's hangar.\r",
      "Otacon! She seems to know exactly where I am even in this damn whiteout. What the hell is going on?\r",
      "Right, now that I think about it - her attacks have been coming from downwind.\r",
      "Damn! She can smell me.\r",
      "A Saint Bernard can find and rescue a lost hiker in the middle of a blizzard in the Alps. If that Beast has an olfactory sensor as keen as a dog's, it's not out of the question.\r",
      "All I can do is try and guess where that thing's going to be - try not to move downwind.\r",
      "Either I do, or I don't.\r",
      "Damn it, Otacon! It's mowing those trees down in one shot! What the hell is that Beast using?\r",
      "A rail gun... We come here to keep them from stealing a rail gun, and here they are using one against us!\r",
      "You're, [sic] right, Otacon. Let's do this.\r",
      "It's either a maneuver designed to minimize friendly fire, or to draw my attention away from Wolf - to protect her...\r",
      "Thanks to the SOP system, no doubt.\r",
      "Kind of like catharsis...\r",
      "Yeah. The wolf dogs.\r",
      "Wolf dogs aren't like other dogs. They're closer to wolves in nature - happier living in the wild than being kept as pets. Even more so now that they're guarding the grave of a loved one.\r",
      "Trust me. I used to live with dogs just like these. I know what I'm talking about.\r",
      "Oh Rose, it's you.\r",
      "No, I'll live.\r",
      "Those things happen every day on the battlefield - they're never easy to hear.\r",
      "PTSD, right?\r",
      "Just goes to show how much faith Liquid has in their combat abilities...\r",
      "Conscience? Liquid? Listen, lady...\r",
      "Maybe not, but it suits me just fine.\r",
      "Look, maybe it seems callous to you, but that's how things are out here - we're talking about survival.\r",
      "I know what you're trying to say.\r",
      "Forget about it.\r",
      "I'll be careful.\r",
      "Rose, you ever have a flashback of a past experience, only it happens differently in the flashback than in real life? A HALO jump, for example...\r",
      "Lately, I've been having these flashbacks where I'm doing a jump except I'm not wearing a parachute. I just fall and fall and then slam into the ground.\r",
      "Why the hell would my subconscious do that?\r",
      "Exercise caution - got it. I guess that means no more careless rolls near the edge of a cliff...\r",
      "(uhh) No.\r",
      "It must have been Vamp who sealed the blast furnace door.\r",
      "No one ever comes down here, and yet there's Gekko everywhere. He must've figured if I couldn't get the door open, I'd come down here. That freak set up a kill zone... Just for me.\r",
      "What does it take to kill this guy? I've done enough damage to finish him, and he's just bouncing back!\r",
      "Damn! So conventional attacks won't do any good?\r",
      "If only we had a bomb - turn him into a cloud of pink smoke.\r",
      "But how?\r",
      "The syringe?\r",
      "Yeah, it's serviceable.\r",
      "(well) I have no idea what that means, but it sounds good to me.\r",
      "Thanks, Otacon.\r",
      "Get closer? What the hell for?\r",
      "What kind of program?\r",
      "But?\r",
      "Seriously?\r",
      "Ok, just tell me how to use it.\r",
      "Let's do it.\r",
      "And Akiba ended up in the drink.\r",
      "How's it going over there, Otacon?\r",
      "You going to be OK?\r",
      "Good. Sounds like everything's under control. But don't count on it lasting. If things get bad, abandon ship. Got it?\r",
      "Don't worry. I'm not ready to hang it up yet. Not until I finish this mission.\r",
      "Weak spot? You mean the bust modeled on Mantis's true face? The one with the leather bands wrapped around it?\r",
      "Colonel, I can't do that.\r",
      "There's no bust.\r",
      "There is no bust here to attack.\r",
      "Otacon, what's going on? I can't move!\r",
      "...\r",
      "Well, I...\r",
      "What the hell?! Whose dumb idea was that?\r",
      "Fine!\r",
      "What is that ghost-looking thing, anyway?\r",
      "Like how Special Forces dress all in black when they go on a raid...\r",
      "But she's controlling dead guys, too. What about that?\r",
      "Really? I hadn't noticed. Any ideas?\r",
      "Use the puppets?\r"
